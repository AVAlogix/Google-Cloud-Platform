# Data Analyst Portfolio Project: Employee Performance Analysis

## Overview
This is a comprehensive data analyst portfolio project focused on employee performance analysis and HR analytics. Using a dataset with five files, I demonstrate how to preprocess and clean the data in **Google BigQuery**. 
Afterward, the cleaned data is uploaded into **Google Looker Studio** (formerly Google Data Studio) to create an insightful dashboard.

The key steps in the process include, from **data preprocessing** to **building a professional dashboard**, including defining a **business problem statement** and utilizing **ChatGPT** to assist with certain tasks.

This project covers essential topics for data analysts, including:
- **Google BigQuery basics**
- **Google Looker Studio dashboards**
- **Portfolio project creation**

This is an ideal resource for anyone looking to build their **data analyst portfolio** or gain insights into **HR analytics**.
